    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit this site! I am a recent university graduate with a BS degree in Computer Information Systems.
        Although my background is in computers, I also have a passion for creating art. My art style reflects my relative mood.
        I am a fan of the weird and wacky, and that may reflect on my personality.
        Although I don't connect well with people, I care deeply for those that care to stay around me :)
